        <br> ...and its nearing demise</h1>
           <p> <b>About Jakarta</b><br>
            Formerly known as Sunda Kelapa, it was a harbor city ruled by the Hindu Padjajaran Kingdom, whom the Portuguese later conquered. 
            It was later conquered by Fatahillah from the Kingdom of Demak in 1527, and renamed it to Djayakarta.
            It later became a trading center for commodity exchange and was popular  among the Europeans who eventually built a central trading hub there.
            In 1619, conquered by the Dutch, Jayakarta became the centre of dutch power in Indonesia, at the time known as Nederlandsche Oost-Indie.  They then renamed the city to Batavia.
            The Dutch reigned over Indonesia for almost 3 centuries (1619-1942), and have built canals, and buildings similar to the Netherlands.
            In 1942, the Dutch surrendered to the Japanese, and the city was renamed once again to Djakarta Tokubetsu Shi, which translates as 'to put aside differencesâ€™.
            On August 17th 1945, Indonesia declared their independence at Djakarta, which was officially renamed Jakarta by the governor on June 22nd 1955.
            <br><br>
            Today Jakarta is home to over 10 million Indonesians. It has become an administrative city and also the business 
            center of Indonesia.

        <h1 style='font-size: 50px;margin-bottom:10px'> Jakarta is sinking...</h1>
        <p> With 1% of the Indonesian population moving each year to Jakarta, the overuse of groundwater is inevitable. 
            This creates instability towards Jakarta's ground, which makes it sink at a faster rate, regardless of 
            climate change. And North Jakarta was the first to experience the damage and consequence.
            <br>
            Although a dam was built to prevent the sea water from penetrating the land, each year they had
            to make the dam taller and fix the cracks that appear. This is not a tangible long term solution. 
            Flooding become a common event and people are fleeing North Jakarta, especially those who live below
            the poverty line.

        <h1 style='font-size: 50px;margin-bottom:10px'> ...And now the President of Indonesia is planning to move the capital to Borneo.</h1>
        <p>With the constant increase of Jakarta's population, the city can no longer keep up with the demands and needs of its citizens.
            To eliviate Jakarta's burden, President Joko Widodo made the bold move to move the capital city of Indonesia to Borneo, now named
            Ibukota Nusantara. And that the civil servants will start moving to the new city in 2026 effective immediately.
