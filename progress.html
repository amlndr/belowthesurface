        <img src='water.jpg' width=70% height=70% id='im'>;
        
        <p>To raise awareness on groundwater overuse, we want people who interact with our
            artefact to be curious and know its impactful consequence to the earth.
            <br>
            By simulating water, we create a waving motion that is triggered by removing a 
            cup of water and just imagine it. Imagine the 10 million people using groundwater 
            everyday.
        </p>
        <p>Below is the interaction chart:</p>
        <img src='interact.png' width=70% height=70% id='im'>
        <p>Based on the chart above, we want our user to understand how their actions can have
          consequences towards nature. Although nature always evolve at a slower pace, 
          humans make the change go at a faster rate. And that is what we want our user to feel,
          and be mindfully curious on how their action can impact nature and its surroundings,
          including humans.<br><br>
          Below is our artefact and how the interaction works.

        <h1>We have experimented on various ways to implement our idea</h1>
        <p>Here's a preview of what we've done so far and how we iterated our design.</p>
        
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted>
              <source src="v0.MOV" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>V0</h3>
            <p>Here we try to experiment on how the planks would behave under the offset
              circles we made.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>


       
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            
            <video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted loop>
              <source src="v1.MOV" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>V1</h3>
            <p>Since the previous one won't stay put, we changed the design and added a 
            small dent below the circles so that the plank would stay put.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            
            <video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted loop>
              <source src="v2.MOV" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>V2</h3>
            <p>Satisfied with our plank design experiment, we wanted to 
              create something organic and one that would flow as one unit 
              to mimic the water's waves. Here we try to use different sizes of
              circles but it didn't move smoothly.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">

          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>V3</h3>
            <p>We then changed the circles to all have the same size like in 
              version 0, and it works great. We also added dents underneath the 
              organic shape to keep she organic shapes in place.

        <h1>Below is a detailed photos for each component.</h1>

            <p><b>The Organic Shape</b><br>
            Inspired by the Surfbench created by Kim Andr√© Lange,
            we used the shape and fit it in a row to help make a wave-like motion. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='column'>
            <img src='1_tusuksate.jpg'width=70% height=70% id='im'/>
            <p><b>The Actuator</b><br>
            By using 1 actuators and have circles put on it in an offset position,
            this is what makes the wave motion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='column'>
            <img src='1_dent.jpg'width=70% height=70% id='im'/>
            <p><b>The Stabilizer</b>
            <br>To make the organic shape into place, we use 3 card boards, with the 
            one in the middle have bits of its parts cut out to fit into the circle.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      
        <h1>We also tested our electronics, using a pressure sensor and a grove motor shield
          with an arduino.
        </h1>
        <p>The pressure sensor and the grove motor shield each have their own arduino, connected
          with wires to communicate to each other. Where the grove motor shield is the client and
        the pressure sensor as the server.<br>
        below is the diagram on how it works.
        </p>
        <img src='diagram.png' width='800'/>
        <p>Next we programmed the artefact so that when a person puts a cup on the pressure 
          sensor, it can detect how much water is in the cup, and it will make the artefact 
        to start moving in accordance to its weight. Where the less water, the faster the actuator moves.</s> </p>
      <p>Below is the video of our programming tests with the artefact.</p> 
      <video width="30%" height="40%" muted controls>
        <source src="exp.Mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
      <p>Our program worked with 100% functionality. The issues lies more on the friection created
        by the organic shape and the actuator itself.
      </p>
      <h1>Though far from perfect, this artefact is a reminder that not
        all changes can be seen.
